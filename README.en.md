# Basic Template for HTML Output

This is a template equipped with the basic elements for creating Quarto documents. By default, it outputs in HTML format. You can export bibliography information in compliance with APA 7th edition; however, support for Japanese references is suboptimal. The template is designed with the idea of recreating the document creation experience similar to Notion.

You can edit the commented-out sections in `_quarto.yml` to render in other formats (though adjustments might not work perfectly). For PDF output, please refer to the following page (<https://www.jaysong.net/RBook/quarto2.html>).
